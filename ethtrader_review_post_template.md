Following [this thread a month ago](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/6o0om9/upvote_if_you_think_ethtrader_should_create_a/), a subset of the EthTrader community [organised](https://icoreview.slack.com) to establish a [set of criteria](https://github.com/EthTrader/ico-review) for the evaluation of ICOs with the aim of education and improved standards. This effort is on-going and all feedback is appreciated on how to improve it's utility to the community.

If you have familiarised yourself with the **KyberNetwork** ICO details, please consider rating their offering based on the criteria the ICO review team have established using [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/uAPWMZJngUxHZAap1). After 24 hours, responses will be aggregated and the results posted **here** (not in a new post).
