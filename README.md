# EthTrader ICO Community Review

Following [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/6o2duw/eth_trader_ico_rating_service_criterion_what/) on the [EthTrader subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/) a community effort was established to crowdsource a set of criteria for evaluating ICOs. Work moved to this repo after stablising from an [initial working doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oWqyVMKQ0-oAJPxNLAWiclqkHHH3TRV_J4dLI6zu6tQ).

## How to use

Each criteria has an associated multiplier which is a suggestion for it's relative importance. The set of criteria is intended to form the basis for crowdsourced reviews by EthTrader users. Scores from users who submitted reviews would be weighted using the multiplier and then aggregated to establish a community review score. A test review was [requested](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/6tg8up/ethtrader_ico_review_for_project_0x_the_form/) and [completed](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/6to94g/project_0x_ethtrader_ico_review/) for the 0x token sale.
